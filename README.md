This AI Assistant is a Python-based project designed to interact with users through voice and text commands, offering a range of functionalities. Built with Tkinter for a user-friendly GUI, it integrates speech-to-text (SpeechRecognition) and text-to-speech (pyttsx3) capabilities for seamless interaction. The assistant performs tasks such as fetching real-time weather updates using web scraping (requests-html), opening websites like Google and YouTube, and providing the current time. This project demonstrates the integration of natural language processing, automation, and real-time interaction within a simple yet effective assistant.
